# sagemaker-titanic
This is a collection of small practical labs I have done when exploring SageMaker. All problems are approached from a learning perspective, I have also noted important things/confusing points. As a beginner you may find it useful.  
The dataset used is [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
AWS has their own example repo [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples), I have also refered it for some of my code.  

In this repo you can find:
- Visualization and feature engineering for the data
- How to train and deploy models
- How to use SageMaker XGBoost as a built-in algorithm
- How to use SageMaker XGBoost as a framework
- How to use SageMaker Hyperparameter tuning to tune and verify the result
- How to associate your work to SageMaker Experiments
- Use SageMaker services from local
- Use SageMaker *in* local
- SageMaker SDK vs Boto3 SDK

Happy coding!
